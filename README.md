# FutureManager

Does your shiny application run some time consuming calculations? Do you wish you could do some other things in the app when waiting for the results? Are you tired of forcing your functions to use `%...>%` operator? Here's the FutureManager!

* Launch multiple long-running processes in the background and keep the app responsive
* You clicked the run button by accident? No worries, just cancel the calculations!
* Progress bar per each process? Yes, please!

Sounds good? 

Run the demo app using `FutureManager::demo()` and feel the possibilites! 

Note: for optimal performance please use `Rscript -e 'FutureManager::demo()'`
